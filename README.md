[Try it here!](http://suzeshardlow.com/virtual_pet/)

A virtual pet you can feed, play with and take for walks.  Watch his weight and happiness levels go up and down!

Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

This is a project I made at Thinkful San Diego (https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/san-diego).
